# PetCare API

This is the API for the project of petcare.
It's being hosted on heroku: https://immense-thicket-15788.herokuapp.com/

But there are currently some issues that I don't know how to solve so it shall be easier to run it locally.

# What I wasn't able to get to

Sadly I was not able to fully implement multilingual, but the database table is there to start the implementation.

# What I have done

Everything else is basically there. There is JWT, you can login/register, make calls and easily run migration/seeders
